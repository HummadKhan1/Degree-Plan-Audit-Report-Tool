The folder titled "Degree Plan & Audit Report Tool" contains the DegreePlan_AuditReport_Tool.jar file and Default.txt file needed to run the program like an application (keep them in the same directory always). The instructions on how to run and use the application can be found in the Final_Report.pdf file in the section titled "Code Documentation."

The folder titled "DegreePlan_AuditReport_Project" contains all the source code that was developed for the application. 
The directory DegreePlan_AuditReport_Project\src\main\java is where the source code for the application can be found. 
Know that the directory Desktop\DegreePlan_AuditReport_Project\src\main\assembly contains a xml file that is used to create a JAR assembly that includes the compiled classes of the project and its runtime dependencies, without the base directory. 
The MainDriver class contains the main() method that drives the entire program. 
The pom.xml file can be found upon opening this folder. 
Lastly, the IDE we used was NetBeans, the IDE typically looks for files (like our Default.txt file) in the project's base directory, also known as the project root or working directory. When you read a file using a relative path, the file path is resolved relative to the working directory. Thus, make sure the Default.txt file is always in the correct location if you are going to run the program from an IDE or the command line. Note that this folder is set up to be opened and worked on using the NetBeans IDE so if you wanted to run the program using a different IDE or using the command line you would have to configure the file locations accordingly, this is why we suggest you run the application using the Jar file within the folder named "Degree Plan & Audit Report Tool."
