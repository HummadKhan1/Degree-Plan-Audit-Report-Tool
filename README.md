# Computer-Science-Project 

Folder Named "Degree Plan & Audit Report Tool" contains the DegreePlan_AuditReport_Tool.jar file and Default.txt file needed to run the program like an application (keep them in the same directory always). The instructions on how to run and use the application can be found in the Final_Report.pdf file in the section titled "Code Documentation."

The folder named "DegreePlan_AuditReport_Project" contains all the source code that was developed for the application. The directory DegreePlan_AuditReport_Project\src\main\java is where the source code for the application can be found. Know that the directory Desktop\DegreePlan_AuditReport_Project\src\main\assembly contains a xml file that is used to create a JAR assembly that includes the compiled classes of the project and its runtime dependencies, without the base directory. The MainDriver class contains the main() method that drives the entire program. Lastly, please always have the Default.txt file in the same folder as the source code.
